# APIs
Different APIs I have Used and links to the Documentation. This list will continue to grow.

This is here for all who need as well as for myself if I ever need a quick rundown of what I did in the past, for projects I have worked on.


# Smartsheets
### (update is coming to smartsheet API as I write this on 6-16-2022, but works for now)
https://smartsheet-platform.github.io/api-docs/

This API will bring in smartsheets as a Dataframe into a jupyter notebook
### Aspects to be aware of:
* All series(columns) are objects and we will need to look at all date and numerics values.
