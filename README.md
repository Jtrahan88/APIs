# APIs
Different APIs I have Used and Link to the Documentation.

This is here for all who need as well as for myself if I ever need a quick rundown of what I did in teh past for projects I have worked on.


# Smartsheets(update is coming to smartsheet API as I write this on 6-16-2022, but works for now)
https://smartsheet-platform.github.io/api-docs/

This API will bring in smartsheets as a Dataframe into a jupyternote book
### Aspects to be aware of:
